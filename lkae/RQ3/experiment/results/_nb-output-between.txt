The statement does not mention a Qatari being killed in Tunisia, nor does it mention the city of Bizerte. The statement actually talks about the humanitarian situation in Palestine, which suggests that it is unrelated to the claim.

The statement appears to be an article about the African Super Cup, specifically the match between Al-Ahly and Berkane, talking about the coach's statements. This Statement does not mention Samar Hosni or the reasoning about her being kept away; therefore it does not support the claim, however, it still does relate in that it talks about the African Super Cup just like the claim.
