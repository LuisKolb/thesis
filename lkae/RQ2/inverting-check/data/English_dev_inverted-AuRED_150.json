  "rumor": "What Moza did towards the Yemeni people is a resounding scandal by preventing Yemenis from entering Qatar who hold the Haya card designated for visitors to Qatar for the World Cup season. However, the Qatari regime closed the doors in the faces of the Yemenis and not anyone else until here and the Qatari position is clear. There must be a quick reaction from the government",

      "RT @sufianjubran: Friends who had received a Haya card and then it was cancelled, contacted me, and today they informed me that the Haya card had been issued with full approval and that they could travel at any time to Qatar to attend the World Cup. Congratulations to everyone and thanks for the efforts of our embassy in Qatar and to Ambassador Rajeh Badi @AmbRajehBadi"

      "The concerned authorities in #Qatar confirmed during our communication with them on several levels that there is no truth to what was raised about preventing Yemenis from attending the World Cup, and that a defect caused the cancellation of these cards for different nationalities before the procedures returned to normal on the applicants\u2019 accounts."

      "I thank the Qatari authorities for the response they showed following the problem that caused a number of Haya cards to be rejected by some Yemenis. Since the first hours, we have contacted the relevant authorities and received promises to address the problem. Indeed, it has begun to be resolved and we have noticed that these cards have returned to work, and the rest of them will be completed in the coming days, according to the responsible authorities. https://t.co/x6VsSGUsia"
